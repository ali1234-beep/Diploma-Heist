# - MAIN GAME TUTORIAL - 

#The game premise is that someone has stolen your diploma (the game has multiple people that is randomized to steal your diploma each time you run the game) you are trying to get your diploma back from the robber by following clues and completing areas around courtice. Once you complete the areas you can confront the robber. You get iq for completing areas and your final iq wil be recorded as a .txt file that will display everytime you run the game and compelte it.

# This game has many difficulties, I recommend you start with level 1 (easy mode), you have to complete 1 area from each main area. The more areas you complete, the higher final iq you will have.

# Items will be used at the end of the game, the main function of the Inventory system is just to see what items you have.

# Some of the questions are unresonably hard and some are really easy, the reason some questions may repeat for one area is because each area has it's own seperate list of questiosn it will ask you, and it's also very hard to come up with questions.
